#Heatmap

###Generating a heatmap through a shader

This is a simple Javascript program that generates a heatmap diagram 
from a two-dimensional array of values.

It uses a vertex shader program to determine color values for the
measurement points which it passes to a fragment shader for interpolation.

WebGL is accessed through [SceneJS](http://scenejs.org/ "").
